# Message-Board
For the Week 4 Assignment to create a message board, I re-imagined what Gen z would be posting on Facebook back in 2006. 

Features include:
  a news feed and a status box, where users post messages to the community
  ability to delete a post from the news feed
  an upvote button, (functionality pending) 

Try it yourself and post a status at the live site:  https://fz-fb.onrender.com/
